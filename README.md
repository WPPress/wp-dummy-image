# WordPress Dummy Image Uploader
WordPress Dummy Image Uploader is simple yet useful WordPress Plugin for developers. 

# Features

The plugin adds an additional tab on the WordPress Media Uploader https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7sj786Pf8F8YnAyV0hrQ3p1ems/edit?usp=drivesdk which will let you one-click upload dummy/lorem-ipsum image to the Media Library.

With the plugin, you can either choose to upload plain image with color options for text and fill colors available in the media popup tab. Or you can simply choose the Keyword for the image.

The tab includes the size of the image you want for the upload. Also, the registered Image sizes are listed which would let you auto-fill the dimension inputs just by clicking on those sizes.

# Installation & Usage

- Install the plugin as any other regular plugin.
- Activate the Plugin from Plugins Dashboard
- Open the media uploader popup (likely while you are creating posts/pages)
- Go to `Dummy Uploader` Tab in your media uploader popup
- Put the Image size, colors (if you are using plain colored image) or Image keyword
- Hit big "Upload Dummy Image" button.
- It might take some time as images are taken from remote servers. Once the image is uploaded to your media library, you will be taken to the Library Tab
